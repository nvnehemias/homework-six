In this assignment, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. I utilized a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a representative model of weather across world cities.
I plot the following graphs: 
*Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
*Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
*Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
*Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
